# RustyGo, my untrusted bot player project

## Development stopped

While I love go and developping an efficient bot, this project also was a pretext to learn a new language, Rust. Unfortunately I spent an unordinate amount of time (3 months) to get anywhere as I was fighting the language more than reinforcement learning which is hard enough. Graphs are especially painful in Rust and Monte-Carlo Tree Search is based on graphs. Furthermore, deep learning based reinforcement learning would be impossible in Rust currently.

I have rebooted a go bot project, [Golem Prime](https://github.com/mratsim/golem-prime) in Nim, a young language I'm much more productive in. Nim has a syntax similar to Python, the speed of C and a focus on expressivity. In about 3 days, I made Golem Prime about 200x faster than RustyGo. I'm also writing my own deep learning library [Arraymancer](https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer) with OpenMP, OpenCL and Cuda backends with reinforcement learning as one of the future focus.

## Why a bot in Rust
I'm an amateur dan player hovering between 1d-3d on KGS and European Go ranking.
I've been interested in Computer Go since I started back in 2004 and followed eagerly the breakthroughs in the past 10 years.

Back in October 2015, I had the sudden urge to program a go bot.
* A bot in Haskell? Interesting but Monads and Functors gave me a headache.
	Also Haskell is reasonably fast but I had a lot of memory overflow with just prime computations so I don't think it will cut it with storing thousands of game trees.
* A bot in C/C++? I don't know C or C++ and it's already been done.
	Plus I like programming in functional style.

What is important for the bot:

* Memory, no leak, fast, compact: Go needs lot of memory operations with lots of possible moves, and board states of up to 400 moves to save in memory.
* Lock-free or at least concurrent data structure: One tree of variations, multiple threads that update it
* Access to neural networks libraries

So I choose Rust:

* The lure of CUDA/OpenCL libraries (Arrayfire, collenchyma)
* The lure of machine learning libraries (Leaf, rusty-machine)
* The lure of lock-free concurrent datastructure (crossbeam, rayon)
* a strong type system
* nice pattern matching (not as nice as Haskell though)
* function chaining without dozens of parenthesis
	if only I didn't have to .collect::<Vec<u16>>() every time
* no Garbage Collector, control of memory layout
* no memory leak (very important)
* Memory on the stack by default (the fastest(TM) )
* fast ~C like
* Good debugguer (LLVM)
* Unit testing included
* A strong and helpful community
* Does the coffee
If only it didn't have all those brackets

Other languague considered:
* Nim, high performance, very nice syntax, strong typing


## History of computer go breakthrough

1. First was the expert systems, with handcoded logic of "good moves"
	Too bad those expert system, collapsed in fights and against silly moves the programmer didn't expect.
2. Second was the statistics system, embodied by the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) revolution.
	Before each move the go program simulate thousands of games and choose the one with best win ratio
	Several evolutions brought them up to dan level on 9x9 on 2008 CPUs :
		* UCT : which balances the Monte Carlo Tree exploration of known nodes vs new nodes
		* RAVE / AMAF : if a move is good later, consider it good also as the first move
		* Integration of heuristics and patterns that influence the Monte-Carlo Tree Search
	Thanks to the statistical approach, programs were much stronger in fights.
3. Third was the DCNNs (Deep Convolutional Neural Network)
	Those are used in combination with MCTS to direct the search to the most promising moves.


## State
RustyGo was started back in October and is currently compilable but buggy as hell, it might as well play random moves.
Also everything is in one file because I was in "hack away" mode and didn't learn how to split a projects into modules.

## Interesting repos
* Easy to dive in
	[Michi](https://github.com/pasky/michi) (Python) 
	[Pony-mcts](https://github.com/Mononofu/pony-mcts) (Pony and Rust)

* MCTS only
	[Libego](https://github.com/lukaszlew/libego) (C)

* Rusty:
	[Iomrascalai](Rust)

* "State of the art"
	* [Darkforest](https://github.com/facebookresearch/darkforestGo) from Facebook Research, using Torch DCNN (Lua and C)
	* [Pachi](https://github.com/pasky/pachi) long-time reference open-source engine before Facebook open-sourced theirs, with early Caffe DCNN support! (C)
	* [Fuego](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fuego/) slightly weaker than pachi but very strong engine as well (C++)


## Future

### Roadmap:
* Find time to work on it
* Modularize the project
* Improve the data structure for concurrency, lock-free
* Improve the light playouts (no heuristics) to the fastest speed (cf pony-mcts and libego)
* Implement heuristics (ladder, local move preference) for heavy playouts
* Create a DCNN policy network to suggest moves
* ...
* ...
 
### Huge brain dump alert: optimization to think of in no particular order
#### Compilation:

#### Vectorization
AVX-512 board size

#### Localization / Branch Prediction / Cache
* Reduce Cache Misses
* Bitboards (needs AVX-512)
* Memoization
* HashMap instead of Match/if to reduce branching
* reduce if statement inside loop or fold. Use map and loop/fold after
* Auto sort MCTS tree according to UCT value (heap tree)
* SSE instruction or Xor or a+b-|a-b| or BLAS or [collenchyma](https://github.com/autumnai/collenchyma)/[Arrayfire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust) to fold compare max(UCT) and reduce branching

#### Randomization / MCTS optimization
* UCT
* RAVE, AMAF (All moves as first)
* Fast number Gen (rdrand Hardware RNG ?)
* [CLOP](https://www.remi-coulom.fr/CLOP/) tuning (Confident Local Optimization for Noisy Black-Box Parameter Tuning)

* FNV Hashmap algorithm (when it's possible to use a custom hasher)

#### Data structure research
Need fast delete of Early Nodes, traversal from leaf to start, very fast append, lock-free, parallelizable, cacheable, low memory use, max of O(1) operations
Board? Fixed Size Struct? Array by macro? Integer parametrized struct for different board size (not possible yet)
